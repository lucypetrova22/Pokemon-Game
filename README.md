# Pokemon-Game

The game simulates a Pokémon battle between the player and a rival Pokémon controlled by the computer. The player selects a nickname for their Pokémon and enters the nickname for the rival Pokémon.
During the battle, both Pokémon take turns attacking each other using different types of moves: Tackle, Scratch, and Surf. Each move inflicts a random amount of damage to the opponent's Pokémon. The battle continues until one of the Pokémon's health points reach zero, indicating that Pokémon has fainted.
